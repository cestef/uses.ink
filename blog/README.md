# Welcome to uses.ink !

This is a minimalistic **blog platform** for anyone to use. It's based on **markdown** files and uses **GitHub** as a storage.

The platform is designed to be as simple as possible. You push files to your repository and we take care of the rest.

<ins>No ads, no trackers, just you and your beloved content.</ins>

## You got a GitHub repo ? You got a blog !

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named [`blog`](github.com/new?name=blog)
2. Create a new file in the repository named `README.md` on branch `main`
3. Visit `<user>.uses.ink` to see your blog !

### My blog is not in a repository named `blog`

You can specify the repository name in the URL like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>`

### The files are not in the root of the repository

The current path can be specified in the URL after the repository name like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>/<path>`

### I am not using the `main` branch

The branch is specified in the URL with the `@` symbol like this: `<user>.uses.ink/<repo>@<branch>`
