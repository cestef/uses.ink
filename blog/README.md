You can specify the repository name in the URL like this: `https://<your-username>.uses.ink/<your-repo-name>/`

### The files are not in the root of the repository

The current path can be specified in the URL after the repository name like this: `https://<your-username>.uses.ink/<your-repo-name>/<your-path>/`
